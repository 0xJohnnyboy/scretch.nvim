# Installation

This plugin requires Telescope and ripgrep to function.

If you don't have ripgrep installed, I recommend you go check the installation procedure [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation).
If you don't want to install it, it should fall back to `find`.

You can paste the following code using Packer, or adapt to your favorite package manager:

```lua
use {
  "Sonicfury/scretch.nvim",
  requires = 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
  config = function()
    require("scretch").setup {
      -- your configuration comes here
      -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
      -- refer to the configuration section below
    }
  end
}
```

# Configuration

Here are the default settings used in Scretch:
```lua
local config = {
    scretch_dir = vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/scretch/', -- will be created if it doesn't exist
    default_name = "scretch_",
    default_type = "txt", -- default unnamed Scretches are named "scretch_*.txt"
    split_cmd = "vsplit", -- vim split command used when creating a new Scretch
}
```
You can copy those settings, update them with your preferences and put them into the setup function to load them.

## Suggested mappings

```lua
local scretch = require("scretch")
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>sn', scretch.new)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>snn', scretch.new_named)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>sl', scretch.last)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ss', scretch.search)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>sg', scretch.grep)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>sv', scretch.explore)
```
